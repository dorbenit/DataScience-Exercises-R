## 📊 HW1: Visualizing Patterns and Choosing the Right Plot

This assignment explores how to use `ggplot2` to create **effective visualizations** that highlight relationships in the data. It includes:
- Comparing multiple plot types (bar charts, scatter plots, boxplots, etc.)
- Using color, shape, and faceting to emphasize group differences
- Selecting visualizations that best communicate specific patterns
- Reflecting on what each plot reveals and why it was chosen
